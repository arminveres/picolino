# Armin's Embedded Library

As a continuous effort to learn embedded programming, as well as make my life easier, I am creating
this library, to complement existing functionalities of other librariers such as `std` itself

## TODO

- move into separate git repo
- Make `ael::array` compatible with std::algorithms
- Create `ael::static_ptr`, a smart pointer (unique for now, shared maybe for later, could use [my previous implementation](https://github.com/arminveres/adv-prog-cpp/blob/main/Exercise_03/pointer_emulation/smart_pointer.h) to orient myself)
- Potentially implement an `std::optional` alternative
